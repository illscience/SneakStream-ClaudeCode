## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=
CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=
MUX_TOKEN_ID=
MUX_TOKEN_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_PROVIDER=
CLAUDE_API_KEY=
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_PROVIDER=mux` to enable the Mux-specific frontend experience; leave it empty or set to `livepeer` to keep the original Livepeer flow. To run the live Mux verification suite, export `MUX_LIVE_TEST=1` (with valid `MUX_TOKEN_ID` and `MUX_TOKEN_SECRET`) before executing `npm run test`. Otherwise the live tests are skipped automatically.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy is using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com).

Don't forget to set your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard!
