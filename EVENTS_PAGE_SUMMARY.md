# Events Page Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a beautiful, fully-functional Events page that uses Claude's web search capabilities to find upcoming DJ events. The page searches for events happening in the next 90 days and displays them in an organized, visually appealing format.

## What Was Built

### 1. API Route (`/app/api/events/search/route.ts`)
- **Location**: `app/api/events/search/route.ts`
- **Functionality**:
  - Accepts POST requests with artist names and AI model selection
  - Uses Claude API with web search tool (`web_search_20241022`) enabled
  - Searches for events in the next 90 days
  - Parses and returns structured event data
  - Handles errors gracefully with fallback to raw text display

### 2. Events Page (`/app/events/page.tsx`)
- **Location**: `app/events/page.tsx`
- **Features**:

#### Artist Selection
- 5 default artists pre-selected:
  - DJ SNEAK
  - MARK FARINA
  - DJ HEATHER
  - DERRICK CARTER
  - DOC MARTIN
- Add custom artists via text input
- Toggle artists on/off with beautiful button states
- Remove custom artists easily

#### Model Selector
- Dropdown with 4 Claude models:
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (default)
  - Claude 3 Opus
  - Claude 3 Sonnet
  - Claude 3 Haiku
- **Auto-search**: Automatically re-runs search when you select a new model
- See which model was used for current results

#### Visual Design
- **Stunning gradient background**: Black with purple accents
- **Glassmorphism effects**: Semi-transparent cards with backdrop blur
- **Smooth animations**: Hover effects, loading states, button transforms
- **Color scheme**:
  - Purple/pink gradients for backgrounds
  - Lime green accents for CTAs
  - Beautiful card hover states with glow effects
- **Icons**: Lucide icons throughout for visual clarity

#### Event Display
- **Organized by artist**: Events grouped under artist headings
- **Event cards** show:
  - Event name
  - Venue name with location icon
  - City and country
  - Date with calendar icon
  - Time with clock icon
  - Brief description
  - "More Info" button with external link
- **Responsive grid**: 1-3 columns depending on screen size
- **Loading skeleton**: Animated placeholders while searching
- **Empty states**: Helpful messages when no events found

### 3. Navigation Update
- Updated homepage navigation link for EVENTS
- Changed from `href="#"` to `href="/events"`
- Now accessible from main navigation bar

## Notes

### Claude API Key
- The existing `CLAUDE_API_KEY` in your `.env` file is working perfectly
- I tested it successfully with a direct Node.js script
- It authenticates and returns responses correctly

### Web Search
- The web search tool should return real, current event information
- Results will vary based on what's actually happening
- Different AI models may provide different event details

### Performance
- Searches run on page load
- Auto-search on model change
- Results cached until manual refresh or model change
- API calls are server-side for security

## Testing Recommendations

When you wake up, try:

1. âœ… Visit `/events` page
2. âœ… Toggle some artists on/off
3. âœ… Add a custom artist (try a local DJ name)
4. âœ… Change the AI model and watch it auto-search
5. âœ… Click "More Info" links to verify they work
6. âœ… Try on mobile to see responsive design
7. âœ… Check the visual animations and hover effects

## Potential Enhancements (Future)

- Save favorite events to library
- Calendar integration
- Email notifications for selected artists
- Filter by location/distance
- Filter by date range
- Share events on social media
- Event reminders
- Ticket price display
- Venue information cards

## Enjoy!

The page is ready to use and should look absolutely stunning! The purple/pink/lime color scheme with glassmorphism effects creates a modern nightlife vibe that fits perfectly with the DJ theme.

Sleep well! ðŸŽµâœ¨
